# life-cycle-cost-analysis-for-selecting-hvac-systems-in-huddersfield-s-terrace-homes

The project aims to conduct a comprehensive Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis to select optimal HVAC systems in mid-terrace homes in Huddersfield. The study seeks to address the challenges posed by the region's unpredictable weather and aging infrastructure by evaluating various heating, ventilation, and air conditioning options. The integration of insulation upgrades alongside the LCC method will provide insights into cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency.

## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis to identify optimal HVAC systems for mid-terrace homes in Huddersfield, addressing challenges posed by unpredictable weather and aging infrastructure.

The project involved a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative technical calculations with qualitative insights from landlord interviews and tenant surveys to evaluate various heating, ventilation, and air conditioning options. Key findings indicated that while traditional gas systems offer lower initial costs, alternative technologies, such as heat pumps, provide better long-term economic and environmental benefits. The research contributes practical guidance for property owners and decision-makers in enhancing energy efficiency and comfort in residential buildings.

## Objectives
- Evaluate various heating, ventilation, and air conditioning options.
- Integrate insulation upgrades to enhance energy efficiency.
- Provide insights into cost-effectiveness and environmental sustainability.

# Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Utilized qualitative data from landlord interviews and tenant surveys, alongside quantitative technical calculations.
- **LCC Analysis:** Assessed installation, operation, maintenance, and disposal costs over a 10-year period.
- **Comparative Study:** Analyzed two HVAC systems: a gas combi boiler and an air source heat pump.

# Key Findings
- **Energy Efficiency:** Targeted insulation upgrades are expected to improve the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from D (55) to C (70).
- **Cost Analysis:** The LCC analysis revealed that while gas systems have lower initial costs, heat pumps may offer better long-term economic and environmental benefits.
- Sustainability: Emphasized the importance of selecting HVAC systems that align with local environmental policies and energy efficiency standards.


# Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced indoor comfort and reduced energy consumption.
- Practical guidance for property owners on HVAC system selection and implementation.
- Contribution to sustainable practices in residential heating solutions.

# Technologies Used
- Excel for data analysis and calculations.
